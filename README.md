# stm32-embedded-project
STM32-based flight computer with sensor fusion, Kalman filtering and telemetry
Project Overview
This repository contains an STM32-based embedded systems project developed using STM32CubeIDE. The project focuses on fundamental and intermediate embedded software concepts commonly used in aerospace systems.
The codebase is structured to be clean and reproducible for academic or internship evaluation.
Goals
-Develop firmware for an STM32 microcontroller
-Read and process sensor data
-Apply basic filtering / data processing techniques
-Prepare the system for telemetry and real-time usage
-Follow professional embedded software practices
